## Specs

Build an application with user authentication and a many-to-many relationship. Here are the features to include:

- The application should have user authentication. A user should be able to log in and log out. Only logged in users should have create, update and delete functionality. All users should be able to have read functionality.
- There should be a many-to-many relationship.
- A user should be able to navigate to a splash page that lists all instances of each class. Users should be able to click on an individual instance to see all the instances that belong to it.

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

- [ ] Does at least one of your classes have all CRUD methods implemented in your app?
- [ ] Are you able to view both sides of the many-many relationship? For a particular instance of a class, are you able to view all of the instances of the other class that are related to it?
- [ ] Are users able to register, log in and log out with Identity?
- [ ] Is Create, Update and Delete functionality limited to authenticated users?
- [ ] Is the project in a polished, portfolio-quality state?
- [ ] Was required functionality in place by the 5:00pm Friday deadline?
- [ ] Does the project demonstrate all of this week's concepts? If prompted, are you able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology?
